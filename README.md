# Bamazon
## *One-stop shopping for your everyday needs*

### If for some reason you are not viewing this elsewhere, go ahead and check it out on my [Github](https://github.com/camhallmen/Bamazon)

Bamazon is a unique webstore application that combines node.js with mysql for a truely one of a kind shopping experience!

All the user must do is download the neccessary npm packages, open up the terminal command line and make their own mysql data base (can't use mine, sorry!).

After that, simply open up the terminal, follow the prompts and select which products interest you!

The user will be shown all products including **name**, **current stock** and **prices**.

**Bamazon** is smart and will not allow the user to purchase more than what is currently in stock of any given product.

After selecting a product ID and entering a quantity, **Bamazon** will inform the user if the sale went through or not.

### A video walk through is also [available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5WB2IUSP4QkVVjkL7tWIW_bfR37Z2qy/view).

## Happy Shopping!
